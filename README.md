A complete game consists of three turns. On each turn, a ball is launched from the center of the window toward the bottom of the screen at a random angle. That ball bounces off the paddle and the walls of the world, in accordance with the physical principle generally expressed as “the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection”.

The play on a turn continues in this way until one of two conditions occurs:
1. The ball hits the lower wall, which means that the player must have missed it with the paddle. In this case, the turn ends and the next ball is served if the player has any turns left. If not, the game ends in a loss for the player.
2. The last brick is eliminated. In this case, the player wins, and the game ends immediately.
